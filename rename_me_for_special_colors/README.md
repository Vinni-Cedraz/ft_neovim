# Info:
    These are more vivid versions of the color schemes we use in ft_neovim
    they were generated using the plugin "mini.colors".
    you can do the same by opening the interactive window and typing "mini" on
    normal mode, and following the guidelines on their documentation:
    https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/doc/mini-colors.txtk

# How to use this:
    If you rename this directory to "colors/", then the color schemes versions in
    this directory will take precedence over their official versions. For example, the
    tokyonight.lua defined in this directory will be the one used when you switch to
    tokyonight, instead of the official one.

# How to stop it:
    If you didn't like the versions in here you can just switch them off by
    renaming the directory to anything else.
